⏺ Looking at the work completed, I can see the combined abilities and skills
   panel has been successfully implemented in PaperSheetLayout.tsx. Let me
  mark the completed tasks and test the implementation in the browser.

⏺ Perfect! The dev server is running successfully on http://localhost:3001/ 
  with no compilation errors.

⏺ All tasks completed successfully! Here's what was implemented:

  Combined Abilities & Skills Panel

  The Paper Sheet layout now features a unified panel that combines ability
  scores with their related skills, matching the classic D&D character sheet
   design:

  Implementation Details:

  Left Side (90px) - Circular Ability Display:
  - 70px diameter parchment-colored circles (#fcf6e3)
  - Red modifier badge positioned on top
  - Ability name label below
  - Clickable for ability check rolls

  Right Side - Grouped Skills:
  - Skills displayed in 11px compact font
  - Grouped by governing ability (e.g., Athletics under STR,
  Acrobatics/Stealth under DEX)
  - 2.5px proficiency indicators:
    - Yellow dot = Expertise
    - Blue dot = Proficient
    - Empty circle = Not proficient
  - Skill bonus displayed on the right in accent blue
  - Clickable for skill check rolls

  Layout Structure (PaperSheetLayout.tsx:127-232):
  - Single "Ability Scores & Skills" panel
  - Grid layout: grid-cols-[90px_1fr] for each ability row
  - 4px spacing between ability groups
  - Skills aligned to start at top of ability circle

  The dev server is running cleanly with no errors at
  http://localhost:3001/. You can now test the Paper Sheet layout by:
  1. Opening a character sheet
  2. Selecting "Paper Sheet" from the layout selector
  3. Viewing the combined abilities and skills in the left column

> don't show the Features & Traits panel that data is shown individually in 
seperate panels

⏺ Done! I've removed the "Features & Traits" panel from the Paper Sheet
  layout since that information is already displayed individually in the
  separate Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws panels above it.

  Changes made:
  - Removed the Features & Traits panel section
  (PaperSheetLayout.tsx:365-377)
  - Removed the unused FeaturesSection import

  The dev server is compiling cleanly with no errors. The right column now
  shows:
  1. Personality Traits
  2. Ideals
  3. Bonds
  4. Flaws
  5. Proficiencies & Languages

  This eliminates the redundancy while keeping all the information visible
  in the more detailed individual panels.
