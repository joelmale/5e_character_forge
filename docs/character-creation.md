# Character Creation Wizard Guide

The Character Creation Wizard guides you through the process of creating a new D&D 5e character step-by-step.

## Step 1: Character Details

- **Name:** Enter your character's name.
- **Alignment:** Choose your character's alignment from the dropdown.
- **Background:** Select a background for your character. This will grant you skill proficiencies and starting equipment.

## Step 2: Choose Race

- Select your character's race from the available options. Your racial ability score bonuses will be applied automatically.

## Step 3: Choose Class & Subclass

- **Class:** Choose your character's class. This determines your hit die, proficiencies, and class features.
- **Skills:** Select your skill proficiencies from the list of options provided by your class.
- **Subclass:** If your class chooses a subclass at level 1, you will be prompted to select it here. Otherwise, subclass selection will happen when you level up.

## Step 4: Choose Fighting Style (Conditional)

- If you have chosen a class that gets a Fighting Style at level 1 (like Fighter), you will be prompted to select one.

## Step 5: Select Spells (Conditional)

- If your chosen class is a spellcaster, this step allows you to select your cantrips and 1st-level spells.

## Step 6: Determine Abilities

- **Method:** Choose your preferred method for determining ability scores:
    - **Standard Array:** Assign the scores 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 to your abilities.
    - **Roll:** Roll for your ability scores using various dice rolling methods.
    - **Point Buy:** Distribute 27 points to purchase your ability scores.
    - **Custom:** Manually enter your ability scores (for homebrew rules or with DM permission).

## Step 7: Choose Feats (Optional)

- If your character is level 4 or higher (or if your DM allows it at level 1), you can select feats instead of an Ability Score Improvement.

## Step 8: Select Equipment

- Choose your starting equipment from the options provided by your class.

## Step 9: Customize Equipment (Optional)

- Browse the full equipment database and add any additional items to your starting inventory.

## Step 10: Finalize Background

- **Personality, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws:** Fill in the details of your character's personality.
- **HP Calculation:** Choose to either take the maximum possible HP for your class or roll for it.
- **Create Character:** Click the "Create Character" button to finalize your character and add them to your hero list.
