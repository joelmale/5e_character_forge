# Using the Character Sheet

The 5e Character Forge character sheet is designed to be a dynamic and interactive hub for all your character's information. Here's how to use its main features:

## Core Stats

- **Ability Scores:** Click on any ability score (STR, DEX, etc.) to make an ability check. A 3D die will roll, and the result will be displayed.
- **Skills:** Click on any skill (Acrobatics, Stealth, etc.) to make a skill check. The roll will automatically include your proficiency bonus if you are proficient in the skill.
- **Initiative:** Click the initiative button to roll for initiative.
- **HP and Rests:** Use the "Short Rest" and "Long Rest" buttons to recover hit points and spell slots. A short rest will prompt you to spend hit dice, while a long rest will fully restore your character.
- **Inspiration:** Toggle the inspiration die on or off by clicking the inspiration button.

## Spellcasting

- **Spell Slots:** Track your spell usage by clicking on the spell slots. Click again to un-use a slot.
- **Cantrips & Spells:** Your known or prepared spells are listed for quick reference.

## Equipment

- **Equipping Items:** In your inventory, click the "Equip" button next to a weapon or armor to equip it. Your Armor Class (AC) will automatically update.
- **Adding/Removing Items:** Use the "+" and "-" buttons to add or remove items from your inventory.
- **Item Details:** Click on an item's name to see its detailed properties in a modal window.

## Leveling Up

- **Level Up Button:** When your character is ready to level up, click the "Level Up" button.
- **Subclass Selection:** At the appropriate level (e.g., level 2 for Wizards), a modal will appear for you to choose your subclass.
- **Ability Score Increases/Feats:** At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you will be prompted to either increase your ability scores or select a feat.
- **Cantrip Selection:** If your class gains a new cantrip at the new level, a modal will appear for you to select it.
